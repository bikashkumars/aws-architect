# AWS Well Architecture framework

Remember P.R.O.C.E.S.S to recall fast (E has no meaning)

1. Performance
2. Reliability
3. Operational Excellence
4. Cost Optimization
5. E - has no meaning**
6. Security
7. Sustainability

## Cloud Architecture Design principle

1. Design for Failtures ( atleast 2 EC2 instances, as anything may fail )
2. Decouple or Loose coupling ( Microservice Architecture, deploy with low dependency, Avoid monolith Apps, Don't install DB on EC2 where App is installed )
3. Elasticity ( Horizontal scaling - Scale-in and Scale-out based on demand )
4. Parallel ( 2 EC2 instaces serving live traffic with ALB )

## AWS Cloud Economics

1. Cost savings ( Cost reduction with On-demand Pay-as-you go model and Spot instances )
2. Staff productivity ( Infrastructure configuration overhead reduced. move away from the day-to-day operational headaches associated with managing IT
infrastructure )
3. Operational resilience (improving SLAs and reducing unplanned outages. AWS CloudFormation/Terraform to automate infra to avoid human errors)
4. Business agility ( Deploying new features/applications fasterand reducing errors. Developers donâ€™t have to wait to get the budget to deploy a full infrastructure )

More on Economics: The rightsizing recommendations feature in Cost Explorer (AWS Cost Management) helps you identify cost-saving opportunities by downsizing or terminating instances in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Rightsizing recommendations analyze your Amazon EC2 resources and usage to show opportunities for how you can lower your spending.

# AWS Well Architecture framework

Remember P.R.O.C.E.S.S to recall fast (E has no meaning)

1. Performance
2. Reliability
3. Operational Excellence
4. Cost Optimization
5. E - has no meaning**
6. Security
7. Sustainability

## Cloud Architecture Design principle

1. Design for Failtures ( atleast 2 EC2 instances, as anything may fail )
2. Decouple or Loose coupling ( Microservice Architecture, deploy with low dependency, Avoid monolith Apps, Don't install DB on EC2 where App is installed )
3. Elasticity ( Horizontal scaling - Scale-in and Scale-out based on demand )
4. Parallel ( 2 EC2 instaces serving live traffic with ALB )
